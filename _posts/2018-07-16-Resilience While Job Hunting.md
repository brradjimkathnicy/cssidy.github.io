title: Resilience While Job Hunting
---

This spring I was unemployed for three months. There was a lot of pressure to find not only a job, but a job that was 
going to further my career, as fast as possible. Each day that I saw my savings decrease I felt a little more anxious. 
I found the right job just in time.

Job hunting is one of the most arduous tasks in the field of computer science. There are many layers of abstraction and 
hoops to jump through. First you must prove intangible, trend-word-inspired attributes about yourself and convince hiring 
managers of your ability to deliver intangible, trend-word-inspired things. There is often testing in the form of logical puzzles, ranked coding 
challenges, coding in front of an audience, and coding under a time restraint to determine your abilities. To become a 
programmer you have to face uncertainty, intimidation, confusion, scrutiny, mental pressure, time pressure, impostor 
syndrome, and more, through 3-5 rounds, each 1/2 a day or more long. Then strategic negotiations. At any 
moment you can be rejected, or worse, ghosted, waiting weeks for a vague apologetically "no" email. Rinse and repeat.

Not that I’m complaining about becoming a programmer, or that I have any tips for landing a job, rather, 
I’d like to share what I did to cope with all these trials amongst the stress of being unemployed.

## Routine
I went to sleep and woke up at the same time every day, got a good rest each night, ate balanced meals, exercised, drank 
a lot of water, abstained from substances, and became a well-oiled machine. This helped me to feel my best, physically and 
mentally. I didn’t see my unemployment as a dead-zone where I could let myself go - I saw myself as still “working”. When 
you have a level mind and body you’re able to seize the opportunities that are thrown at you.

## Syllabus
To stay positive and progressive while I was trying to land the dream job, I made it a point to have a 
day-to-day purpose. I took micro steps to improve my skills and stay relevant. I think, actually, my programming skills improved more than
they do with on-the-job training. Likely because I was undertaking much more diverse study. I tried to choose a couple areas of improvement that are relevant to 
my career, and a couple that were'nt. Focusing all of your energy on one thing can exhaust you. Don’t deplete yourself; 
just stay in the game, keep yourself engaged, and sharpen your skills. For example, as a web developer, 
I spent a lot of time studying JavaScript. But I also picked up some new complimentary skills in Python and art (history, design principles, techniques). Pretend 
you’re back in college, but could choose any class you’re interested in. There are so many resources on the web, be it online courses, videos, 
nteractive tutorials, and books. Make a list of everything you want to learn, and consult it when you’re 
feeling directionless.

## The World
When I stay inside too long, away from others, I can get narrow-minded. It’s important to reintegrate with the outside 
world and see the big picture again after a long day of coding challenges and scanning job listings. Whenever I got frustrated, a change of 
scenery always helped my mood. Break up the monotony. Here are a handful of inexpensive activities that might inspire you to mix up your schedule:
 
- Go to your favorite building, find it’s most attractive angle and take a photo
- Go for a walk in the park with a friend
- Ride your bike to see a sunset
- Go to the public library, do an [old school search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sa-qzNe6tw&frags=pl%2Cwn)
- Go for a run around the neighborhood
- Read a print magazine
- Go to a restaurant with a friend and only order appetizers
- Wander about identifying trees and plants
- Fix something outside
- Bask in the sun
- Go to the beach
- Watch the skaters at the skate park
- Call a relative
- Build a snowman

## Creature Comforts
On a particularly disappointing or exhausting day, I’d carve out time for myself in the evening for 
rejuvenation. I like to make a nice, healthy dinner with lots of fresh herbs, veggies and a 
good slab of protein. Or light a candle and take a bath with an oatmeal essential oil bath bomb. Or stretch on 
the floor while listening to my favorite music. It's equally important to engage in relaxing, mindless activities.
