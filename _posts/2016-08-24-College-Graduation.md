title: College Graduation
---

I earned my B.S. in Web Design, Development & Infrastructure last week from Champlain College. Now I'm an official nerd. My first emotions were in this order:

- shock
- exhaustion
- jubilation
- pride

What does "web design, development & infrastructure" entail? Basically everything about the Internet. I've learned how to build and publish websites (both front-end HTML, CSS, JS/jQuery and back-end MySQL, PHP, Python), along with how to navigate ecommerce systems, computer security, and ethical hacking/penetration testing. Also, usability and user interaction design. I've learned how to set up and manage both Windows and Linux servers and services. I also understand how physical and wireless networks work - their protocols, radio frequencies, and hardware. The Internet is one of my main passions, and for the financial investment in the degree, what I figured would deliver the greatest return.

What's next? I've decided to take three months off to decompress, pursue personal projects, and scope out the ideal job. A sampling of the personal projects I'm undertaking are here (update: as of February 2017 the cross-through text means it was achieved):

- ~~Ubuntu home office network (file server, automatic backups to all machines, connect printer)~~
- Build a super router with pfSense
- ~~Study distributed systems, bots and botnets, maybe build a benevolent botnet~~
- ~~Study Git and Github~~
- ~~Python web crawler~~
- ~~Python Beautiful Soup project~~
- ~~Study email protocols and mechanisms (IMAP, POP, SMTP), and begin working with them in Python~~
- ~~Study CSS pre-processors, begin working with SASS~~
- ~~Get my first Arduino or Raspberry Pi and do something cool with it~~
- ~~Build a Jekyll blog~~

After this sojourn, I'll have to join a company out there. I can see myself best-suited for a position as a network administrator, web designer, or web developer. Some day I'd like to go on to graduate school. Probably researching distributed systems or programming of some sort. But I'm not rushing it. I want to find a place where I can be happy. Where I can get intellectual stimulation and challenge, do cool things with super computers, perform meaningful behind-the-scenes work, and seek solace from my student loans.
