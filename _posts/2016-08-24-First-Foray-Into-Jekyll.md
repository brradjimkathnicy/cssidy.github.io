title: First Foray Into Jekyll
---

This blog is built with Jekyll (update: as of February 2017 this blog is made with Django), and 
Jekyll is good for me.

Using Jekyll, I am encouraged to develop skills in these areas:

- CSS pre-processors
- Git and Github
- Ruby and Gems
- Markdown
- Linux command line
- DNS

Jekyll may be good for you too!
