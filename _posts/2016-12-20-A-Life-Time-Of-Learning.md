title: A Life Time Of Learning
---

I'm a month into my post-college job hunt. I've submitted two dozen applications and been to half a dozen interviews. It's a little daunting, but I have hope that it will all work out. I'm at a bit of a stalling point with the holidays upon us. Every company uses it's own stack of technologies and programming languages, and it's hard to find the exact match of skills. I need to keep my head up, and keep finding mentors and positive growth opportunities.

I purchased the book [Automate The Boring Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) and have been working my way through every exercise. My Raspberry Pi helps motivate me. This past week I've jumped into Django, which is actually kinda fun and revolutionary to my development process. I've noticed about my learning style that I get excited and start looking up libraries that interest me, seeing what other people are doing, then I try to copy them, then fail, because I don't have the precursors, then return to where I was before so that I can learn what I need to understand the projects I admire. So, I learn in an upward zigzag.

I'm realizing that with web development there is so much to learn. There's computer science theory, logic, algorithms, data structures, mathematics and design patterns. There's networking protocols, domains, email and web servers. There's personal computer hardware and OS's. There's software like Adobe, IDE's, browsers and their quirks. There's graphic design and staying abreast of new trends. There are many, many languages with their own strengths and weaknesses. And to really compete, I should learn frameworks. The list of things to learn goes on and on.

I should probably just focus on the one thing I really love. But I love so many aspects of the web, and I want to be a polymath web developer. I want to achieve mastery of the Internet. There's a lifetime of learning ahead of me.
