title: A Life Time Of Learning
---

I'm a month into my post-college job hunt. I've submitted two dozen applications and been to half a dozen interviews. It's a little daunting, but I have hope that it will all work out. I'm at a bit of a stalling point with the holidays upon us. Every company uses it's own stack of technologies and programming languages, and it's hard to find the exact match of skills. I need to keep my head up, and keep finding mentors and positive growth opportunities.

I purchased the book [Automate The Boring Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) and have been working my way through every exercise. My Raspberry Pi gives me extra motivation. This past week I've jumped into Django, which is actually quite a bit of fun, and revolutionary to my development process. I've noticed about my learning style that I have a difficult time staying on a linear path - I get excited, and start looking up libraries that interest me, seeing what other people are doing, then I try to copy them, then fail, because I don't have the precursors, then return to where I was before. So, an upward zigzag.

I'm realizing, that with web design & development, there really is so much to learn. Besides learning how to use software (Adobe suite, different IDE's, browser quirks) and staying abreast of design patterns there are many, many languages with their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, the Django framework isn't very compatible with PHP. So I have to rewrite my PHP mailer forms in Python (Django has a lot of tools for this) if I want to migrate one of my websites to Django. And to really compete, I should learn React or AngularJS (Javascript frameworks from Facebook and Google, respectively). Beyond that, when I become more skilled with Python, I want to learn Lisp or Haskell, something that's totally different. The list of things to learn goes on and on.

I should probably just focus on the one thing I really love. But I love so many aspects of the web, and I want to be a polymath web developer. I want to achieve mastery of the Internet. There's a lifetime of learning ahead of me.
