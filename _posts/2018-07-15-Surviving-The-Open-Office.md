title: Surviving the Open Office
---

I've worked in many open offices. They're touted as the 21st century's interior design solution to 
increased employee communication, collaboration, happiness, and ultimately efficiency. But, they have instead 
become one of the most dreaded office configurations among workers, possibly even less popular than the cubicle.

Open offices _can_ work well for certain job positions. However, in software development I find them to be a
huge hindrance to the type of work that's expected of me to produce. Despite that, they seem to be all the rage right
now. Sure, there are phases in software development that require brainstorming and intense socialization, but when that's 
through we generally all disperse to tackle our individual piece of the code. Open offices are not conducive to concentration 
and logical problem solving, which is largely a solo task with occasional collaboration from peers when stuck. And because 
there's great variety in how employees answer "What helps you concentrate?" open offices are bound to rub people the wrong 
way.

I concentrate best in a room with a window to a natural scene. At home my office window looks out to a lush tree
line. I keep the window open for a breeze and the sound of the weather, birds, insects, and leaves rustling in the wind. I also 
outfit myself with ergonomic furniture and accessories to be as physically comfortable as possible. The room is 
moderately bright, with lots of light options for me to choose from as the day progresses to night. The temperature is a very
consistent 67-69 degrees in winter and 72-75 degrees in summer. Sometimes I listen to soft ambient electronic music, 
but about half the time it's just silence and the sounds of the keyboard and outdoors. I close my door when I need total 
concentration.

## Distractions

These are all situations that I have encountered in an open office which distract me from my work:

- Co-workers who clip their nails while at their desk
- Co-workers who announce every frustration/victory with a grunt or "Yaaasss!"
- Co-workers who hum to themselves
- Co-workers who anxiously click their pens
- Co-workers who ask questions of fellow devs without doing a basic Google search
- Co-workers who slam their water bottle down every time they use it
- Co-workers who eat at their desk
- Co-workers who bring stinky food back to their desk (I have been a culprit of this in the past. I realized 
this is a disruptive habit while at my first open office job. One afternoon I microwaved a just-add-water Thai noodle 
bowl and had to smell garlic and onions for the rest of the day. I felt so horrible and guilty! Since, I only eat in 
the kitchen area, or I'll go outside and find a picnic table or park bench.)
- Co-workers that have clunking TMJ jaws that choose to eat peanut-butter bagels at their desk
- Co-workers who slurp, suck, smack and gulp soup every day at their desk
- Co-workers who eat snacks in loud, crinkly containers, like Cheez-Its, at their desk all day long
- Co-workers who leave dirty plates, bowls and mugs for weeks at their desk that attract gnats
- Co-workers who anxiously shake their legs which rattles and vibrates my desk
- Co-workers who have restless leg syndrome who can't help but shake their legs all day long
- Co-workers who come in to work sick, hacking and snuffling all day long and risking infecting others
- Co-workers who breath heavily through their mouth
- Co-workers who have loud conversations at their desks
- Co-workers who tap along to the music in their headphones (This one puzzles me, isn’t the reason why they're
wearing headphones to keep their music to themselves? Now they’re going to make me put on headphones to drown them out
while they 'rock out'?)
- Co-workers who leave their headphones on their desk, loudly blasting, while they are elsewhere
- Co-workers who do not silence the texting on their phone
- Co-workers who leave their phone on their desk, un-silenced, and get frequent calls


## Solutions

Unfortunately, I have only found a couple reliable solutions to all these problems.

- Put on headphones and listening to music when co-workers are doing annoying things
- Leave the office during lunch
- Encouraging (subtley) others to not eat at their desk

The other solutions I've conjured up all require confrontation with the offending co-worker. There's a 
risk that the co-worker will take your feedback poorly. It requires a careful, tactful approach or else you could
sour your working relationship with them. I don't have any advice for this as it has not been successful for me. 
Additionally, some of these situations just cannot be resolved by a polite request. For example, a co-worker
with restless leg syndrome who's forced to sit programming for 8 hours a day will probably not be able to 
stop vibrating your desk with their shaking legs. But, if you can configure your immediate surroundings to not 
absorb the vibrations from their shaking, you can avoid upsetting them by bringing up the subject. Ideally, open
offices will go out of fashion. But until then, team leaders should be responsible for handling these confrontations 
in the most adroit way possible. But that requires speaking up, and
making sure that you are not contributing to any annoying behaviors yourself...
