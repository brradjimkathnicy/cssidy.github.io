title: Two Years Since College Graduation
---

It's been two years since I graduated from college. Time has felt both very slow and very fast, and 
I'm sad to say time is passing as I type. I wish I could rewind time and do it all again. But I can't. 
So what have I been up to since I graduated?


- I moved.
- I had five programming contracts.
- I'm out of the dreaded "junior developer" woods.
- I'm currently looking for a mid-level position.
- I befriended three cool techie women through work.
- I bought a used car, after five years being car-less. It's kind of a disaster.
- I volunteered for the UX Burlington conference twice.
- I saw my dream musicians, the band Yes, with Jon Anderson.
- I participated in two costume parading events.
- I redesigned my blog twice in Django, and am now back to using Jekyll with GitHub Pages.
- I contributed to two open source code projects.
- I visited MIT's campus and media lab in Boston, MA.
- I went on a road trip in a van from Vancouver, WA to Santa Cruz, CA.
- I went on three weekend trips to New York City.
- I snowboarded at five different local mountains.
- I have kept up with my terrible student loan payments.
- I bought my first Apple computer. I still do all my programming on my Ubuntu computer.
- I did not finish either of my two long-standing side-projects, but I have gained considerable insight into how they "should" work and have restarted them countless times. Which has been good practice.
- I gave two public talks/tutorials at my local Python developers group.
