title: On The Path
---

The more time I spend designing and programming, the more I feel this path is right for me.

I feel satisfied solving problems, seeing my work take shape in the browser and the physical world, 
seeing my scripts accomplish tasks, optimizing processes, understanding how systems work, building, creating, 
dreaming. I can see myself doing this for the rest of my life. Whether I'm a designer, programmer...whatever 
I have been, am, become, I feel the underlying drive is the same.

I do get a little intimidated by seeing others my age who've already been to MIT and Stanford with 
grad degrees and are working at Google or Facebook or Microsoft or Amazon. It's easy to fall into 
impostor-syndrome: wishing I had taken algebra II in high school, that I was instead a savant, had 
followed the migration to Silicon Valley, that I was a little older, that I was wealthier, from a more 
connected background, or not been a woman and subject to the accompanying prejudice...but I am pulling 
myself out of that spiral more and more now. I’m realizing that I am good, even just as good, and I don’t 
need to have any of those titles or strive to be any of those things besides just...me. Wow, that’s liberating!

When I focus on what I enjoy about my work, it allows me to be happy in the path to that Senior Developer 
job title, at whatever pace it’s going. Otherwise, it becomes a stressful to-do list. I think I have found 
confidence that I am doing what I should be doing.
